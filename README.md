# Infrastruct
is a logic-based belief-agnostic jurisprudence framework that interprets various divine sources through the lens of clear logical systems in order to create a coherent legal code.

Infrastruct is

- based on major world religions (Abrahamic and Dharmic traditions)
- not a religion
- isn't against religion
- includes philosophical stances
- no fixed doctrine
- comparative friendly
- explains rather than dictates
- something for everyone to use

Infrastruct uses:
- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Perplexity Search API (with Searx fallback)
- Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite
- V with Veb coming soon

# v0.2.0
- major redesign of results
- added perplexity search
- started working on vlang backend
- fixed in text referencing
- added sikhism, buddhism and hinduism
- ability to toggle religions

# todo
- let model pick a religion to focus on if the search is specific to something e.g. "what is kashrut" search only judaism.
- sync veb functionality to the next
- the ability to puzzle together beliefs and standpoinrs together like a jigsaw to create your own legal code based of searches and ideas you like from different frameworks.
- shareable links and a db
