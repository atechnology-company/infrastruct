# Infrastruct
is a logic-based belief-agnostic jurisprudence framework that interprets various divine sources through the lens of clear logical systems in order to create a coherent legal code.

It hosts ALIF (Artificial Learning Integration for Fataawa) v2, an AI powered search engine to direct you towards rulings from different religions based on your query.

Infrastruct is

- based on monotheism
- not a religion
- isn't against religion
- no fixed doctrine
- logic filtered
- comparative friendly
- explains rather than dictates
- something for everyone to use

Infrastruct is for logicians who want to follow Abrahamic religions. They struggle with the problems and inconsistencies in those religions that push them away. They want to follow objective morality. They aren’t evil, or at least aren’t trying to be. They want to do good in the world and submit to one God, but they don’t want to feel villainised for doing something they don’t believe or being pushed into something they don’t agree with.

Infrastruct uses:
- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Google Search API (stop ratelimiting me)
- Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite
