# Infrastruct
is a logic-based belief-agnostic jurisprudence framework that interprets various divine sources through the lens of clear logical systems in order to create a coherent legal code.

It hosts ALIF (Artificial Learning Integration for Fataawa) v2, an AI powered search engine to direct you towards rulings from different religions based on your query.

Infrastruct is

- based on major world religions (Abrahamic and Dharmic traditions)
- not a religion
- isn't against religion
- no fixed doctrine
- logic filtered
- comparative friendly
- explains rather than dictates
- something for everyone to use

Infrastruct is for logicians who want to follow world religions. They struggle with the problems and inconsistencies in those religions that push them away. They want to follow objective morality. They aren't evil, or at least aren't trying to be. They want to do good in the world and seek spiritual truth, but they don't want to feel villainised for doing something they don't believe or being pushed into something they don't agree with.

Infrastruct uses:
- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- Perplexity Search API (with Searx fallback)
- Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite
- V with Veb coming soon

# v0.2.0

- ability to toggle religions

# todo
- let model pick a religion to focus on if the search is specific to something e.g. "what is kashrut" search only judaism.
- sync veb functionality to the next
- the ability to puzzle together beliefs and standpoinrs together like a jigsaw to create your own legal code based of searches and ideas you like from different frameworks.
